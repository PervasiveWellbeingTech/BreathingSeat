# BreathingSeat

Both "Breathing_Seat_Arduino" and "seat_on" are complete Arduino code folders that can be opened and put onto an Arduino using the Arduino IDE which can be found at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

To use this code in the Arduion IDE, download the IDE, open the folder ("Breathing_Seat_Arduino" or "seat_on"), inside the folder there is a .ino file which you can open using the Arduino IDE.

"Breathing_Seat_Arduino" folder:
	Default functionality for breathing seat.  Swipes up and down.  Has variables to adjust breaths per minute, height of user, duration of breathing exercise, and duration of hold between breaths

"Breathing_Seat_Arduino_OLD.ino" file:
	This code can be substituted for the code in the "Breathing_Seat_Arduino.ino" file in the "Breathing_Seat_Arduino" folder.  It is an older version of the code had the functionallity to hold down the button until the seat stops to terminate the breathing seat funciton early.
	note: This code is not implemented well, but was a quick fix for a demo.

"seat_on" folder:
	Code turns on all actuators in the seat when the green button is pushed and turns off all actuators when the red button is pushed.
